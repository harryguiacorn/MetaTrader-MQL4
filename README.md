Key Features:

- ADX Line (Yellow): Measures trend strength, ranging from 0 to 100. A value above 20 generally indicates a strong trend, while below 20 suggests a weak trend or choppy market.
Directional Movement Indicators (Green & Red Bars):
- +DI (Green): Represents buying pressure. A higher +DI than -DI suggests an uptrend.
- -DI (Red): Represents selling pressure. A higher -DI than +DI suggests a downtrend.

Benefits:

- Trend Strength Identification: Helps identify strong trends for potential trading opportunities.
- Trend Direction: Combined with +DI/-DI, you can gauge the direction of the trend (uptrend or downtrend).
