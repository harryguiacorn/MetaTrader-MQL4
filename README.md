Key Features:

- ADX Line (Yellow): Measures trend strength, ranging from 0 to 100. A value above 20 generally indicates a strong trend, while below 20 suggests a weak trend or choppy market.
Directional Movement Indicators (Green & Red Bars):
- +DI (Green): Represents buying pressure. A higher +DI than -DI suggests an uptrend.
- -DI (Red): Represents selling pressure. A higher -DI than +DI suggests a downtrend.

Benefits:

- Trend Strength Identification: Helps identify strong trends for potential trading opportunities.
- Trend Direction: Combined with +DI/-DI, you can gauge the direction of the trend (uptrend or downtrend).

## Cloud

The standard Ichimoku cloud indicator can be visually cluttered and overwhelming for traders. This indicator aims to simplify Ichimoku analysis by using colored dots to highlight significant signals without obscuring the chart.

- Green dots: Appear when the Tenkan-sen (blue line) crosses above the Kijun-sen (red line). This is typically seen as a bullish signal in Ichimoku Cloud analysis.
- Orange dots: Appear when the Tenkan-sen (blue line) crosses below the Kijun-sen (red line). This is typically seen as a bearish signal in Ichimoku Cloud analysis.
- Yellow dots: Appear when the price candles break above or below the Ichimoku Cloud. A break above the cloud is generally considered a bullish sign, while a break below is seen as bearish.
- Purple dots: Appear at the price point where it first breaks through the Parabolic SAR (SAR) indicator. These dots can be used as an initial stop-loss placement and can be gradually trailed up to lock in profits as the price moves favorably.
